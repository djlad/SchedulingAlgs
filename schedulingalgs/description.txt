Build Command:
makeandrun.bat (crossplatform)

run command:
./sim -d -a algorithmName inputfile

-If no input file is specified, generates input file
-If the -d flag is set, each process is printed
-If the -a flag is set only specified algorithm will be used
-Order doesnt matter except for input file which must be last
